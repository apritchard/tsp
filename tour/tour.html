	<h1>Tour The Galaxy</h1>
	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>Tour the Galaxy is a Star Trek Online mission that asks a player to fly to as many star systems as they can in a 15 minute window. The available systems are specified by the mission and the more of them a player reaches, the better the rewards. However, there is not enough time to easily fly to them all. A few strategies can be employed to increase ship speed, but this page focuses on the algorithmic problem of devising the shortest travel route between the systems.</p>
	
	<h2>The Solution(s)</h2>
	<p>For a short video demonstrating how the below data was gathered, please visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZWqS0-JmX8">The Youtubes</a>.</p>
	<p>Want to make your own routes? <a href="files/TravelingStarshipSolver.jar" download>Download the program</a>. I made this for my own amusement, but if you find any bugs, feel free to let me know (or fix them yourself!) through my contact info at the <a href="https://github.com/apritchard/tsp">github repo</a>.<p>

	<p>I've used the following two images to perform a number of shortest path analyses based on pixel distances. The Tour the Galaxy destinations are marked in red on the map to help me click them when generating paths.</p>

	<p>These solutions produce the minimum total pixel distance route that covers all the desired points. The arrows are just for clarity; the routes may be traveled in either direction.</p>

	<p>A variation on the standalone optimal solution involves using an Instance Change to reposition yourself within the zone. I reran the standalone maps and specified a Warp Point to which all other points can travel for cheap (20px for this calculation).

	<p>Most players will have at least one transwarp available during the course of this mission. These images compare routes with different transwarp options. The idea is that you would travel the optimal route for one quadrant, then transwarp to the other quadrant and follow the most optimal route given your starting point.</p>

	<h2 id="zoneboundary">Zone Boundary Solutions</h2>
	<p>A number of Transwarps are inconveniently located or require you to pass a second loading screen to reach Sector Space. This motivated me to investigate a couple of Zone Boundary solutions as well. These solutions require both a modified Alpha and Beta Quadrant map for each approach.</p>
	<p><em>NOTE: Because of the way my program specifies required nodes, the first half of the routes are listed in reverse. Just follow them backward.</em></p>
	<h3>Tellar -> Teneebia</h3>
	<p>Zoning out from the top of the Alpha Quadrant puts you almost right next to Teneebia and is not too far from Tellar, so that is the only Alpha -> Beta zone transition I evaluated so far.</p>

	<p>To try and normalize this data, I used a teammate to measure some distances in lightyears and compare them to pixel distances. For the Alpha Quadrant map, we came up with a value of about 8.39 pixels per lightyear, and for the Beta Quadrant map, about 6.14 pixels per lightyear. I then combine both paths to find a total distance metric.</p>

	<p>The main point of note here is that doing optimal Beta Quadrant trumps most other optimization. Transwarping to Defera is faster than transwarping to DS9 by a substantial margin, making that route a clear leader, though starting BQ from Sol system is close enough to optimal that it is a reasonable alternative for people who cannot transwarp to Defera.</p>
	<p>Another notable consideration is that the TW to Beta Quadrant solution is pretty competitive with other options and requires one fewer zone transfer. I don't know if that zone transfer is worth 20 LY of flying time, but it almost certainly pushes TW to Beta Quadrant into 2nd place. Similarly, the Zone Boundary crossings at the bottom of the list only require one zone transfer, and so could be reasonably competitive if you were not able or interested in using transwarp.</p>
